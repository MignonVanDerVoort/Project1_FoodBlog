This was my very first front-end project for Code Factory and therefore only uses HTML and CSS (SCSS).

**Note: Not all of the links are active, as this was not the goal of the project. Only the "Home" and "Recipe of the Month" links are active. 

**Please note I have kept the projects exactly as they were when I first created them, not enhancing or beautifying them in any way so that progress can be seen from project 1 to project 3.**
